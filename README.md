PLANNING THE USE OF HEDERA'S ID TOKEN RESOURCES TO MAKE HEDERA THE CENTER OF ALL DLTs

I have read the HIP guide but really can not understand and implement the suggested contribution order on HIP

By the way, I have an idea about planning the length of the number sequence in the ID token
Hopefully, Devs will read and pay attention to this suggestion, if this suggestion is really useful, please help me post it on HIP

Initiative on how to exploit and use hedera token resources to help hedera become the most distributed data platform and the center of all distributed data ecosystems
So what I want to propose here is to plan the issuance of ID tokens from the beginning, to understand this issue clearly, I will give specific instructions through the following fields and practical applicationsÖ

BY PROVIDING THESE SPECIFIC EVIDENCES AND CASES BELOW
WE WILL SEE THE POWER OF HEDERA TOKEN IS BEING DISPLAYED IN NUMERICAL FORM TO EXPLOIT THAT THOROUGHLY AND IMPROVE HEDERA'S POWER TO ATTRACTIVELY USER ATTRACTION NETWORK-WIDE

AND THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE WISH TO PLAN RESOURCES ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH OF THE CHARACTER OF THE DIGITS IN THE STRUCTURE OF HEDERA'S TOKEN ID
WILL HELP HEDERA IS COMING SOON TO THE CENTER OF NETWORKS

CURrently, NFT ISSUANCES, OR TOPIC MESSENGERS... ARE ALL ASSIGNED DATA IN ORDER OF CURRENT TOKEN IDS, THIS IS A WASTE OF DIGITAL RESOURCES, BECAUSE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF NFT PRODUCTS EVERY DAY, BILLIONS OF TOPIC IDS EVERY DAY, AND MOST OF THE S

- the creation of NFTs as one-time use items: movie tickets, a product in a mass production line, a time-limited coupon....
In the future, there will be billions of NFTs created every day like that, and it is also possible be deleted immediately afterwards

Meanwhile, at the present time, such NFTs are being mined in order of token IDs equivalent to current wallets or token IDs,
which is a waste of resources because after the expiration date, or after the product is used
it will be permanently deleted
For that reason, assign numerical values ​​to these NFTs with a number of characters from 15 numeric characters or more
and give priority to numerical sequences with a number of characters <15 characters for wallet accounts, user accounts, or identity accounts
domain names, users, user accounts, securities accounts, ID cards, licenses...

REASONS TO CONSIDER THE EXPLOITATION OF HEDERAR'S TOKEN ID RESOURCES + SPECIFICALLY, THE DIRECTION SHOULD BE CONVENTED CHARACTER LENGTH FOR EACH TYPE
EXAMPLE FOR NFT OR TOPIC MESSENGER + WILL BE DEFAULTED TO A TOKEN TYPE WITH A LENGTH OF 15 CHARACTERS OR MORE, OTHERWISE, PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO THE USER'S PERSONAL WALLET, IDENTITY, ACCOUNT WITH
TOKEN IDS WITH A LENGTH OF LESS THAN 15 CHARACTERS

1- ADVANTAGES OF HEDERA'S TOKEN FORMAT

- Tokens are displayed in numeric form. This is an outstanding advantage that no other platform has. It is superior in the following points.

+ Financially.
Hedera tokens are like bank accounts, and users can easily transfer money to each other by

providing each other with account numbers, which is very close to every real-life business platform

While other platforms and ecosystems have to transfer money to each other using wallet codes, the rules of wallet codes are not easy to remember

Moreover, later on, hedera is the center of networks

users or business platforms, they are willing to transfer bitcoin to each other, or transfer any tokens to each other

they are also willing to pay a very small fee to use hedera wallet codes, which will be very convenient and easy

instead of transferring money internally between networks with messy wallet codes and no memorization rules

+ In terms of identity management

- Digital identities such as citizen identification cards in each country, degrees, graduation certificates or most identification issues are numbered in order and need long series of numbers long short characters

IN CONCLUSION, I RECOMMEND HEDERA DEVELOPERS TO REVIEW AND LISTEN TO THIS PROPOSAL
Recognize the power of the digital hedera token, and exploit it in a way that applies to real-world applications
